MicroTProbe
===========

A breakout for the [TMP102] [1] from Texas Instruments small enough to fit inside a Â¼ inch copper tube. This was inspired by the [SparkFun breakout board] [2] for the same chip.

This is designed to be used with 1/4 inch copper tube and thermal putty to create a water-sealed temperature probe. Instead of using a header to hookup, magnet wire is threaded through the holes and soldered. Using a solderable magnet wire is recommended.
